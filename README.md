# Dog APIs

**Practice projects** from the **Web Services and APIs** course in [Java Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/java-developer-nanodegree--nd035) at Udacity.

[_See the final project of this course._](https://github.com/Foystor/CarBackendSystem)

Develop `REST API`, `GraphQL API` and `Microservice` that return a list of dogs from an embedded `H2` in-memory database, and learn how to secure, consume, document, and test APIs and web services.
